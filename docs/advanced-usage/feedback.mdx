# Collecting Feedback

Gather user ratings and feedback after a chat session.

```js
sdk.requestRating();
```

- Prompts the user for a rating (e.g., stars, thumbs up/down)
- Can be triggered at the end of a chat or on demand

### Example Use Case
- Ask for feedback after resolving a support ticket

### Edge Cases
- If called multiple times, only the latest prompt is shown
- Works with both live and automated chat sessions
